No compilation necessary. Unpack the .tar.gz and run with the syntax specified below from the project folder.

For encoding:

    ./stegan --encode <CARRIER> <PAYLOAD> <OUTPUT>

        where
        <CARRIER> is the path of the audio file you want to hide the data in.
        <PAYLOAD> is the path of the data file you want to hide in the carrier.
        <OUTPUT>  is the path to the file where you want to write the copy of the carrier with the payload hidden within it.

For decoding:

    ./stegan --decode <CARRIER> <OUTPUT>

        where
        <CARRIER> is the path of the audio file a payload hidden within it.
        <OUTPUT>  is the path where you want to write the payload to.

Settings:

    Settings are configurable via the settings.rkt file in the src directory. See file for descriptions of how to set each. 
    Some settings include:

    1. Whether to fail if the carrier cannot fit the payload or encode as much as possible
    2. The trade off between noise, desity, and reliability

    Empirical results show best results when used in conjunction with mid range (ex. except0.wav in the tst directory) 
    or higher picted audio files. By default, settings are configured to this type of audio.

For more information on how the system works, see the NOTES file.
